Functions related to accessing native handles. 

{\bfseries{By using the native access functions you assert that you know what you\textquotesingle{}re doing and how to fix problems caused by using them. If you don\textquotesingle{}t, you shouldn\textquotesingle{}t be using them.}}

Before the inclusion of \doxylink{glfw3native_8h}{glfw3native.\+h}, you may define zero or more window system \doxylink{_console_manager_8h_ab2d7ab3465c4ea6c2054e6307dde8255}{API} macro and zero or more context creation \doxylink{_console_manager_8h_ab2d7ab3465c4ea6c2054e6307dde8255}{API} macros.

The chosen backends must match those the library was compiled for. Failure to do this will cause a link-\/time error.

The available window \doxylink{_console_manager_8h_ab2d7ab3465c4ea6c2054e6307dde8255}{API} macros are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+EXPOSE\+\_\+\+NATIVE\+\_\+\+WIN32}
\item {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+EXPOSE\+\_\+\+NATIVE\+\_\+\+COCOA}
\item {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+EXPOSE\+\_\+\+NATIVE\+\_\+\+X11}
\item {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+EXPOSE\+\_\+\+NATIVE\+\_\+\+WAYLAND}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The available context \doxylink{_console_manager_8h_ab2d7ab3465c4ea6c2054e6307dde8255}{API} macros are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+EXPOSE\+\_\+\+NATIVE\+\_\+\+WGL}
\item {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+EXPOSE\+\_\+\+NATIVE\+\_\+\+NSGL}
\item {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+EXPOSE\+\_\+\+NATIVE\+\_\+\+GLX}
\item {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+EXPOSE\+\_\+\+NATIVE\+\_\+\+EGL}
\item {\ttfamily GLFW\+\_\+\+EXPOSE\+\_\+\+NATIVE\+\_\+\+OSMESA}
\end{DoxyItemize}

These macros select which of the native access functions that are declared and which platform-\/specific headers to include. It is then up your (by definition platform-\/specific) code to handle which of these should be defined.
